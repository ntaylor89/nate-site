      <p>Hello, my name is Nate Taylor.</p>
      <p>I'm a web develper living in Boise, Idaho</p>
      <p>
        I'm currently paid to write Ruby and JavaScript,
        but I always love learning and working with new tools/technologies.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe we should strive to make the web a more inclusive space.
        This means treating accessiblity as a first class concern,
        listening to your critics, and treating others as they would like to be treated.
      </p>

      <p>
        I love automating tasks big and small. I love the *nix command line.
        And, like most Boiseans, I love beer, beards, and bicycles.
      </p>
    </div>
